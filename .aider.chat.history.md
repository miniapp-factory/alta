#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to describe the logo you want to generate.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A dynamic logo featuring a stylized rocket ascending from a stylized coin. The rocket is rendered in a gradient of deep blue to vibrant green, symbolizing growth and innovation. The coin beneath the rocket has a subtle metallic sheen with a faint circuit pattern etched across its surface, representing blockchain technology. The background is a soft gradient from light gray at the top to white at the bottom, providing a clean, modern backdrop that highlights the central imagery. The overall composition conveys momentum, trust, and forward‑thinking investment opportunities.
